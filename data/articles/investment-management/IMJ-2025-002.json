  "title": "Investor Oversight or Undue Influence? Reassessing BaFin's Stance on AIFM Portfolio Control",
  "abstract": "This article critically examines the March 2025 Draft Position Letter issued by BaFin on investor involvement in AIF portfolio decisions. While reaffirming the AIFM's exclusive mandate under the AIFMD, BaFin's strict stance on veto rights, LPAC involvement, and investor oversight diverges from more pragmatic regulatory approaches in other EU jurisdictions.",
