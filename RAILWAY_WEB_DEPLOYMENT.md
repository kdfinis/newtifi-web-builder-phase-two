# Railway Web Deployment - OAuth Backend

## üöÄ **Deploy via Railway Web Interface**

Since CLI login requires browser interaction, let's use Railway's web interface:

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. Visit: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"

### **Step 2: Connect GitHub Repository**
1. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select: `kdfinis/newtifi-web-builder-phase-two`
3. Choose "Deploy Now"

### **Step 3: Configure Deployment**
Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project and:
- Install dependencies from `package.json`
- Start the server with `node express-server.js`
- Assign a public URL

### **Step 4: Get Railway URL**
After deployment, Railway will provide a URL like:
```
https://newtifi-web-builder-phase-two-production.up.railway.app
```

### **Step 5: Update OAuth Configuration**
Once you have the Railway URL, I'll update the configuration to use it for production OAuth.

## üéØ **Expected Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Localhost**: OAuth works (local Express server)
- ‚úÖ **newtifi.com**: OAuth works (Railway server)
- ‚úÖ **Both systems**: Working together seamlessly

## üìù **After Railway Deployment:**
1. **Get the Railway URL** from the dashboard
2. **Update Google OAuth** redirect URI in Google Cloud Console
3. **Update LinkedIn OAuth** redirect URI in LinkedIn Developer Console
4. **Update frontend** to use Railway backend for production
