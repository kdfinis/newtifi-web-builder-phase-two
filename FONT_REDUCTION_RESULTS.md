## ðŸŽ¨ Design Benefits Achieved

1. **Consistency:** 64% reduction in font size variations
2. **Maintainability:** Much easier to manage and update
3. **Performance:** Smaller CSS bundle (reduced from 81.72kB to 81.38kB)
4. **Design System:** More cohesive typography hierarchy
5. **Accessibility:** Better defined text scaling
6. **Responsive Design:** Cleaner breakpoint management

## ðŸ“ˆ Impact Metrics

- **Files Modified:** 23 TypeScript/TSX files
- **Total Replacements:** 69 font size instances
- **CSS Bundle Size:** Reduced by 0.34kB
- **Maintenance Complexity:** Significantly reduced

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Work (Optional)

The remaining 5 font sizes are mostly from:
- Third-party libraries (VS Code, date picker)
- HTML semantic elements (small, sub, sup)
- CSS inheritance patterns

These could be further reduced by:
1. Customizing third-party components
2. Overriding HTML element defaults
3. Standardizing inheritance patterns
