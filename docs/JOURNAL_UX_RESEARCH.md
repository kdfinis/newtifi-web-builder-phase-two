# Journal UX Research Notes (Draft)

## Scope
This document summarizes common UI/UX patterns found across top-tier academic journals and scholarly platforms. It is intended to guide NewTIFI Publishing toward a consistent, research-grade interface that is accessible, indexable, and user-friendly without paywall friction.

## Competitor Benchmarks (Qualitative)
- Nature Portfolio
- Science/AAAS
- SpringerLink
- Elsevier/ScienceDirect
- Wiley Online Library
- Taylor & Francis Online
- SAGE Journals

## Common Article Page Patterns
- **Persistent metadata header**: Title, authors, publication date, journal/volume/issue, DOI.
- **Abstract-first layout**: Abstract and keywords visible above fold.
- **Immediate access controls**: Clear buttons for PDF, HTML, and supplemental materials.
- **Citation tools**: Copy citation, RIS/BibTeX export, and “Cite” modal.
- **Author details**: ORCID badges, affiliations, contact/corresponding author labels.
- **Section navigation**: Sticky table of contents for long-form articles.
- **Usage metrics**: Views/downloads and altmetric badges (optional but common).
- **Related content**: “Recommended articles” and “More from this journal”.

## Journal Landing Page Patterns
- **Clear journal identity**: Title, scope, ISSN, publisher, frequency.
- **Call for papers**: Submission guidelines and editorial policies prominently.
- **Issue/archive access**: Chronological issues or volume/issue navigator.
- **Editorial board**: Verified names and affiliations, transparency for trust.
- **Search and filters**: Discipline filters and author/topic search.

## UX Expectations for a “Top Tier” Feel
- **Hierarchy & readability**: Strong typographic scale and whitespace.
- **Metadata density without clutter**: Use chips/labels and collapsible sections.
- **Accessibility-first**: Proper heading order, contrast, and keyboard navigation.
- **Performance**: Fast first paint, minimal layout shift, and fast downloads.

## Observed Friction Points To Avoid
- Buried abstract (below multiple sections)
- Download buttons hidden behind multiple clicks
- Inconsistent DOI/metadata formatting
- Unclear journal branding across pages
- Overloaded hero areas with marketing copy
