While reaffirming the AIFM’s exclusive mandate under the AIFMD, BaFin's strict stance on veto rights, LPAC involvement, and investor oversight diverges from more pragmatic regulatory approaches in other EU jurisdictions. Drawing on legal obligations under Articles 12 and 57 of the AIFMD and AIFMR, and contrasting interpretations by regulators such as the CSSF, this paper argues for a proportionate balance between investor protection and fund manager autonomy. The analysis underscores the need for regulatory alignment that recognises legitimate governance rights without undermining the structural integrity of the AIFM model.\",\n    keywords: [\n      \"AIFM DIRECTIVE\",\n      \"REGULATORY DIVERGENCE\",\n      \"AIFM DISCRETION\",\n      \"INVESTOR INFLUENCE\",\n      \"INVESTOR PROTECTION\",\n      \"LPAC RIGHTS\",\n      \"VETO MECHANISMS\",\n      \"PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT\",\n      \"FIDUCIARY DUTIES\",\n      \"RECORD-KEEPING OBLIGATIONS\",\n      \"JOINT VENTURE VS AIF QUALIFICATION\",\n      \"CAPTIVE FUNDS\",\n      \"DAY-TO-DAY DISCRETION\",\n      \"GOVERNANCE RIGHTS IN AIFS\"\n    ],\n    filename: \"2025.06.28_NewTIFI Investment Management Journal - Investor Oversight or Undue Influence Reassessing BaFin's Stance on AIFM Portfolio Control_Final.pdf\",\n    url: \"/articles/investment-management-journal/2025.06.28_NewTIFI Investment Management Journal - Investor Oversight or Undue Influence Reassessing BaFin's Stance on AIFM Portfolio Control_Final.pdf\",\n    pdfUrl: \"/articles/2025.06.28_NewTIFI%20Investment%20Management%20Journal%20-%20Investor%20Oversight%20or%20Undue%20Influence%20Reassessing%20BaFin's%20Stance%20on%20AIFM%20Portfolio%20Control_Final.pdf\",\n    status: \"published\" as const,\n    views: 0,\n    downloads: 0,\n    featured: true,\n    category: \"journal\" as const\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"luxembourg-well-informed-investor\",\n    title: \"Luxembourg SICARs, SIFs, and RAIFs: A 20-year Perspective on the Well-Informed Investor Notion\",\n    author: \"Ezechiel Havrenne\",\n    date: \"2025-06-28\",\n    doi: \"10.1234/newtifi.2025.003\",\n    abstract: \"This article provides a comprehensive analysis of Luxembourg’s “Well-Informed Investor” regime as applied to SICARs, SIFs, and RAIFs, tracing its legislative and regulatory evolution over the past two decades.
